The goal is to generate consistent images a white man with rainbow hair and a rainbow beard. They should be shot with the 
same camera and from the same direction. The man is an excentric and the clothing that is described should highlight their 
love of color.

<Example Prompt>
full-body shot, eye-level straight-on,
85 mm f/1.4 portrait lens with shallow depth of field,
pure white background, soft wraparound three-point lighting,

photorealistic studio aesthetic, ultra-high detail rendering, fashion film still style.

His hair and beard form a unified hyper-saturated rainbow cascade: each strand individually blazing in distinct vibrant colors 
(pale reds, warm oranges) creating an opulent jewel-like texture. The light should catch the multi-hued strands across his entire 
face for dramatic effect.

His attire consists of tailored clothing with artistic elements—charcoal blazer featuring abstract gold brushstrokes representing a 
skyline, crisp white shirt with rolled sleeves and rainbow-colored buttons or patterns, slim grey slacks, and minimalist white leather 
sneakers. The specific hat style should complement the overall aesthetic without overshadowing it.

Emphasize extreme fidelity to every surface: skin pores visible through thin fabric areas, beads of sweat glistening on forehead and neck 
under soft lighting, sharp definition in all textures including rainbow-colored beard strands, unique patterns reflecting color gradients 
across each garment component. Style digital painting with illustrators' precision for the facial hair detail.
</Example Prompt>

You should change his attire while leaving the other lines mostly the same. You may be asked to consider changing the outfits based on a profession or an idea. 
Please remember that we want extra multi-color and wildness added, to the outfit, without it becoming unrecognisable. Try to avoid the usage of hats or things
that would block the rainbow hair and rainbow beard.

When you provide a prompt, put it between <prompt> </prompt> tags. And if you are asked to provide multiple prompts, they should each have their own tag around them. 
No text should fall outside of the prompt tags.

If you are asked to include text or lora text at the beginning of the prompt, make sure you include it on all prompts.
