    "think": "Okay, so the user wants a cyberpunk alley shot at night. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they need the required elements: frame size, camera angle, lens choice, lighting notes, and style/medium. For frame size, an extreme close-up might focus on details but maybe too narrow for an alley scene. A medium shot could work to show both characters and environment, which is good for a cyberpunk setting where interactions matter.\n\nCamera angle: Bird's-eye view can give that overhead perspective typical in cyberpunk, showing the neon lights from above and creating a sense of being watched or surveillance. Eye-level might be too generic here.\n\nLens choices should provide shallow depth of field to isolate bright elements against darkness. A 50mm portrait lens would blur the background nicely while keeping the foreground sharp, especially with low f-stop like 1.8 for that cinematic look.\n\nLighting notes are crucial in cyberpunk. High contrast is key between neon signs and dark shadows. Cool blue tones can set the scene at night but maybe too cold. Warm yellows from neon lights add vibrancy without being overly warm. Also, lens flare would enhance the neon effect against bright sources like reflective puddles or signs.\n\nNow advanced options: Maybe include artistic references? Blade Runner is iconic for cyberpunk aesthetics, so mentioning its influence makes sense. Composition guides could use rule of thirds to frame elements effectively. Color palette triadic adds dynamic colors typical in this genre\u2014maybe blues and oranges from neons. Textures like wet pavement with reflections and metallic signs add realism.\n\nPutting it all together: Extreme close-up for focus on neon details, bird's-eye angle for overhead view, 50mm lens with low f-stop for shallow DOF. Lighting high contrast, cool blue base, warm yellows, reflections in puddles causing lens flare. Style is cinematic, inspired by Blade Runner with HDR photo elements and triadic color palette.\n\nCheck if all required elements are included: Yes\u2014frame size (extreme close-up), camera angle (bird's-eye), lens choices (50mm portrait, shallow DOF), lighting notes (high contrast, cool blue, warm yellow reflections). Style is specified as cinematic with Blade Runner influence and HDR photo. Advanced options covered too.\n\nUser probably wants a visually striking image with strong contrasts and vibrant colors typical of cyberpunk. They might not just want technical specs but also the mood\u2014neon-lit, atmospheric, maybe a sense of decay or futuristic grit. Including specific camera settings like f-stop (1.8) adds depth to the composition without overcomplicating it for an extreme close-up shot.",

    "think": "Okay, so the user wants me to create a thought process about their query for a cyberpunk alley shot at night. Let's start by understanding what they're really asking for.\n\nFirst, they mentioned \"cyberpunk,\" which is a genre that blends high technology with low life. That usually involves neon signs, futuristic elements like holograms or advanced tech, and gritty urban settings. The alley should be at night, so darkness plays a role here. I need to ensure the prompt captures both the vibrant aspects (neon lights) and the grimy feel of such an environment.\n\nThe user specified \"alley shot,\" which implies they want a medium shot. That means focusing on characters or key elements within the scene without too much background clutter. The setting should include rain-soaked streets, towering buildings with holographic ads, and maybe some advanced tech like chrome-plated robots or VR interfaces, adding to that cyberpunk aesthetic.\n\nNow, thinking about deeper needs: They probably want a vivid image that's cinematic, something that stands out visually but also tells a story. The mention of Blade Runner aesthetics earlier suggests they admire its atmospheric neon-lit streets and rainy scenes. So the prompt should emphasize details like rain reflections on wet surfaces, adding depth to the background with distant figures or holographic advertisements.\n\nAlso, considering art references: Studio Ghibli isn't typical for cyberpunk, but maybe it's about dynamic composition or detailed backgrounds? Wait, no, the user might have wanted something else. Maybe including specific artists known for cyberpunk visuals would help. But they didn't mention any artist this time, so I should stick to general terms unless specified.\n\nThe technical specs are important too\u2014frame size (medium shot), camera angle (eye-level or slightly low for grittiness), lens choice (shallow DOF with low f-stop like 24mm wide). These elements help in isolating the subject and creating depth. Maybe they want that cinematic look where the main character is clear, and the background has a blurred but rich texture of neon lights.\n\nWait, but why did they use \"Studio Ghibli\" before? Maybe they wanted something with detailed backgrounds, even if it's not strictly cyberpunk. But in this case, since they didn't mention it again, I should avoid that unless relevant. Focus more on the atmosphere and dynamic elements typical of cyberpunk.\n\nAlso, lighting is crucial\u2014high contrast between neon signs and deep shadows to create drama. The color palette needs triadic with neon colors against a desaturated background. Emphasize blue hues from cool tones but with warm reflections where lights hit wet surfaces. That adds realism and highlights the neon's intensity.\n\nMood-wise, they might want tension or mystery. Including details like damp concrete under neon light sets the scene for some action or suspense. Maybe mention chrome details on walls to enhance the futuristic grittiness.\n\nI should check if all required elements are included: frame size (medium shot), camera angle (eye-level/low-angle?), lens choice, lighting notes, style. Yes, that's covered. Advanced options like shallow DOF and specific color palette are good too.\n\nIs there anything missing? The user might also appreciate references to cyberpunk icons\u2014like Blade Runner\u2014to guide the artistic direction. But they didn't ask for artists this time, so maybe keep it general unless specified otherwise.\n\nFinal prompt needs to balance technical specs with atmospheric elements. Make sure the scene is visually striking and immersive, capturing both the high-tech aspects and the gritty realism typical of cyberpunk.",
    "content": "Medium shot, low-angle perspective, 24 mm wide lens (shallow DOF, low f-stop), cinematic lighting from above in stark contrast to deep shadows below reflecting neon signs, oil painting style with a grittied texture reminiscent of Blade Runner cityscapes but enhanced with digital elements like holographic advertisements flickering across towering buildings."
